# Installation

Installing Clockwork is quick and easy, and should take less than a few seconds. The install script is the fastest way to set it up, it handles downloading the binary for your platform and adding it to the path.

### Windows

Run this command in Powershell:

```shell copy
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Turtlepaw/clockwork/refs/heads/main/install/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | Invoke-Expression"
```

<Callout type="info">
  You can set a custom installation path by appending the path to the script, like:

```shell copy
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Turtlepaw/clockwork/refs/heads/main/install/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | Invoke-Expression -ArgumentList "-installPath 'C:\CustomPath'"
```

It's highly recommended to use the default path as there may be issues with the script if you use a custom path.

### Linux/MacOS

```shell
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Turtlepaw/clockwork/refs/heads/main/install/install.sh | sudo bash
```

<Callout type="info">
  This script will download the latest release of Clockwork and add it to your
  path.
