# Installation

Installing Clockwork is quick and easy, and should take less than a few seconds. The install script is the fastest way to set it up, it handles downloading the binary for your platform and adding it to the path.

### Windows

Run this command in Powershell (as Administrator):

```shell copy
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Turtlepaw/clockwork/refs/heads/main/install/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | Invoke-Expression
```

<Callout type="warning">
  You must run the script as Administrator or it will fail.
</Callout>

<Beta>Custom Installation Path</Beta>

You can set a custom installation, replacing `C:\Your\Desired\Path` with your desired path:

```shell copy
$scriptContent = (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Turtlepaw/clockwork/refs/heads/main/install/install.ps1" -UseBasicParsing).Content
Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([ScriptBlock]::Create($scriptContent)) -ArgumentList @("C:\Your\Desired\Path")
```

<Callout type="warning">
  It's highly recommended to use the default path as there may be issues with
  the script if you use a custom path.
</Callout>

### Linux/MacOS

```shell
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Turtlepaw/clockwork/refs/heads/main/install/install.sh | sudo bash
```

<Callout type="info">
  This script will download the latest release of Clockwork and add it to your
  path.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
  Manual installation of files in `wff-build-tools` is no longer required
</Callout>

## Default Download Locations

| Operating System  | Path                      |
| :---------------- | :------------------------ |
| Microsoft Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\Clockwork` |
| Linux             | `/usr/local/bin`          |

<Callout type="warning">
  Mac OS is currently not *officially* supported, but you may be able to use the
  Linux script.
</Callout>

## Uninstalling Clockwork

We're sad to see you go, if you have encountered any issues, please open an issue.

<Steps>
### Delete the installation folder
<Tabs items={['Windows', 'Linux']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```shell
rm "$CLOCKWORK_HOME"
```
</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
rm -rf "$CLOCKWORK_HOME"
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Remove environment variables

Clockwork sets 2 environment variables:

- `CLOCKWORK_HOME`
- `PATH`

You will have to remove/modify them manually. An easy way to edit environment variables on Windows is [Microsoft Powertoys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/#environment-variables).
