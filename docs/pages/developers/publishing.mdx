# Publishing a package

<Steps>
  ### Create a `clockwork.yaml` file in the root of your repository.
  <Cards style={{ width: 280 }}>
    <Cards.Card
      icon={<span class="material-symbols-rounded">description</span>}
      title="Creating a clockwork.yaml file"
      href="/developers/package"
    />
  </Cards>

### Build your package

It's now time to build the contents of your package, weather it's a tool or a UI package.

### Publish a GitHub release

Clockwork, by default, clones the latest tag of a repository. It's heavily recommended to create a release tag for your package so that clockwork doesn't pull breaking changes or commits that aren't ready for production.

### Add your package to the registry

Once you've created a `clockwork.yaml` file in the root of your repository, you can add your package to the registry. This will allow users to install your package without needing to provide a URL.

<Cards style={{ display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<span class="material-symbols-rounded">add</span>}
    title="Adding your package to the registry"
    href="/developers/registry"
  />
</Cards>
</Steps>
