# Publishing a package

<Steps>
  ### Create a `clockwork.yml` file in the root of your repository.
  <Cards style={{ width: 280 }}>
    <Cards.Card
      icon={<span class="material-symbols-rounded">description</span>}
      title="Creating a clockwork.yml file"
      href="/developers/package"
    />
  </Cards>

### Publish a GitHub release

Clockwork, by default, clones the latest tag of a repository. It's heavily recommended to create a release tag for your package so that clockwork doesn't pull breaking changes or commits that aren't ready for production.
