# Manifest

The manifest is a YAML file that contains shortcuts to popular packages. It's used by Clockwork to install packages quickly.

#### Requirements for a package to be added to the manifest

If you meet all these requirements, feel free to create a pull request.

- The package must be open-source and available on GitHub.
- The package must have a `clockwork.yml` file in the root of the repository.
- The package's name is not already reserved in the manifest.
