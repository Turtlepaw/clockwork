# Manifest

The manifest is a YAML file that contains shortcuts to popular packages. It's used by Clockwork to install packages quickly.

### Packages in the manifest

<Manifest />

<Callout type="info">
  The component above dynamically fetches packages from the manifest, so there's
  no need to update the documentation when adding a package.
</Callout>

#### Requirements for a package to be added to the manifest

If you meet all these requirements, feel free to create a pull request.

- The package must be open-source
- The package must have a `clockwork.yml` file in the root of the repository.
- The package's name is not already reserved in the manifest.

_Even if you meet all the requirements, your pull request may  be rejected, but you are still **encouraged to create a pull request** if you haven't already._

### Adding your package to the manifest

<Steps>
### Fork and clone the repository
[Fork](https://github.com/Turtlepaw/clockwork/fork) the repository and then clone it:

```shell
git clone <your-fork-url>
```

### Add it to `manifest.yml`

In this example, `xml-preprocessor` is the name of the package (used for installing, e.g. `clockwork add xml-preprocessor`) and `url` is the GitHub URL, which Clockwork will automatically resolve the latest version to install.

```yml
xml-preprocessor:
  url: https://github.com/gondwanasoft/xml-preprocessor.git # git url to your package
```

</Steps>
