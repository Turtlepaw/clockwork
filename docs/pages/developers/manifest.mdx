# Manifest

The manifest is a YAML file that contains shortcuts to popular packages. It's used by Clockwork to install packages quickly.

#### Requirements for a package to be added to the manifest

If you meet all these requirements, feel free to create a pull request.

- The package must be open-source and available on GitHub.
- The package must have a `clockwork.yml` file in the root of the repository.
- The package's name is not already reserved in the manifest.

### Example manifest format

In this example, `xml-preprocessor` is the name of the package (used for installing, e.g. `clockwork add xml-preprocessor`) and `url` is the GitHub URL, which Clockwork will automatically resolve the latest version to install.

```yml
xml-preprocessor:
  url: https://github.com/gondwanasoft/xml-preprocessor.git
```

<LinkButton
  text="View manifest.yml"
  link="https://github.com/Turtlepaw/clockwork/blob/main/manifest.yml"
  target="_blank"
  icon={<Github className="w-5 h-5" />}
/>
