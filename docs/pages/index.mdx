## About

Clockwork is like `npm install` + `npm build` for Watch Face Format projects. It manages all your dependencies and building your watch face, reducing the painful parts of building watch faces using Watch Face Format.

## Overview

Let's take a look at what Clockwork can do. We'll start by creating a `clockwork.yaml` and downloading a few packages:

```shell
$ clockwork init
$ clockwork install example-ui-pkg
$ clockwork install xml-preprocessor
```

Here's the watch face component we'll be using:

```xml filename="watchface-pp.xml" {3-5}
<WatchFace>
    <Scene>
        <Group width="450" height="200" x="-50" y="170" name="TextGroup">
            <Import href="packages/example-ui-pkg/text.xml" />
        </Group>
    </Scene>
</WatchFace>
```

Our watch face file and packges are setup, now we can now build our watch face:

```ansi
$ clockwork build
[36mClockwork CLI - the open-source package manager for Watch Face Format - v1.1.5-alpha.3[39m

```

<Callout type="info">
  If [XML Preprocessor][1] is installed, it will process the `<Import />` and
  compile the contents of `packages/example-ui-pkg/text.xml` into the raw
  `watchface.xml` which will be built.
</Callout>

Now it's installed on our device and the sample component has been successfully imported. Here's a screenshot of the watch face:
