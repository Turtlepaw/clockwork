# Creating a watch face

<Steps>
### Create a new project
You can follow [Android's official guide](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/wff/setup) to setup your new project.

### Initialize it as clockwork project

```shell
clockwork init
```

<Callout type="info">
  You can now [add packages](/guides/packages) to your project.
</Callout>

### Build and install your watch face

This will preprocess (if [XML Preprocessor](https://github.com/gondwanasoft/xml-preprocessor) is installed) your watch face, build it using gradlew, and install it to a connected device.

```shell
clockwork build
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you have multiple devices connected, Clockwork will prompt you to select a
  device.
</Callout>
