# Creating a watch face

<Steps>
### Create a new project
The quickest way to start building your watch face is with our [official template](https://github.com/WearOSCommunity/wf-template).

<Cards style={{ width: 290 }}>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<span class="material-symbols-rounded">developer_guide</span>}
    title="Official Template"
    href="https://github.com/WearOSCommunity/wf-template"
  />

  <Cards.Card
    icon={<span class="material-symbols-rounded">android</span>}
    title="Android's Official Instructions"
    href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/wff/setup"
  />
</Cards>

### Initialize it as clockwork project

```shell
clockwork init
```

<Callout type="info">
  You can now [add packages](/guides/packages) to your project.
</Callout>

### Build and install your watch face

This will preprocess (if [XML Preprocessor](https://github.com/gondwanasoft/xml-preprocessor) is installed) your watch face, build it using gradlew, and install it to a connected device.

```shell
clockwork build
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you have multiple devices connected, Clockwork will prompt you to select a
  device.
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">
  `clockwork build` can't build signed release bundles suitable for uploading to
  [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console).
</Callout>

</Steps>

### Command line options

| Option              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-d`, `--debug`     | If [XML Preprocessor](https://github.com/gondwanasoft/xml-preprocessor) is being used, passes `-d` to the preprocessor for extra output and retains `watchface.xml` after building the watchface |
| `-r`, `--release`   | If true, will run [memory footprint evaluator](https://github.com/google/watchface/tree/main/play-validations) and `gradlew bundleRelease`                                                       |
| `-a`, `-all`        | Allow incompatible (non Wear OS) ADB devices to be install targets                                                                                                                               |
| `--non-interactive` | Avoid interactive prompts                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Debugging

Installation and runtime errors (_eg_, bad XML, missing resources) can be seen in the logcat by filtering for `com.google.wear.watchface.runtime`. If you're not using Android Studio, try:

```shell
adb logcat --pid=$(adb shell pidof -s com.google.wear.watchface.runtime)
```

{/* If you're using [XML Preprocessor](https://github.com/gondwanasoft/xml-preprocessor), `build.bat` will normally delete the `watchface.xml` file it creates if the build is successful. This avoids confusing search results in _Android Studio_ (_etc_). If you want to retain `watchface.xml` (_eg_, to help with debugging), use `build.bat -d`. */}
